When the maxNbPackets is increased, both in inBuffer and outBuffer of the Network class will store more transactions.

Therefore, there will be less CPU Yielding from the methods that need to access those buffers if they are: empty and full, for inBuffer and outBuffer respectively.

Thus, increasing the size of these buffers, speeds up the processing time of the transactions and makes communication between Client and Server faster.
